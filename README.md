Here's the detailed project breakdown for **ReportEngine**, an enterprise-level reporting dashboard I'm building. The goal is to create a high-performance, full-stack reporting tool capable of handling large datasets smoothly.

### The Big Picture

* **Project Goal:** To deliver a robust, enterprise-grade reporting dashboard.
* **Repo Structure:** It's a monorepo with a Node.js backend and a React frontend.
* **Backend Focus:** The backend handles everything from database migrations and query optimization to test coverage for core reporting and pagination logic.
* **Frontend Focus:** The frontend is a React app designed for a clean user experience.

### What I'm Building & Why It Matters

This project isn't just a simple dashboard; it's a demonstration of skills critical for building scalable applications.

| Feature | Key Skill Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Database & Queries** | Advanced DB programming, query optimization, and handling high-volume datasets using strategies like materialized views. |
| **Code Quality** | Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code for both the backend (Node) and frontend (React). |
| **Testing** | Building comprehensive test suites to ensure logic, pagination, and reporting are reliable at scale. |
| **Deployment** | Handling the full-stack deployment process for a modern web application. |

The core tech stack includes **React** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, and **Supabase/Postgres** as the database.
